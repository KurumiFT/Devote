# Devote to development

## Why "Devote"?

Devote was created by a lazy developer and is aimed at developers with any experience, from beginners to professionals. Many packages bring something new to the already proven packages, and the most detailed documentation will not leave you at a loss. The package is still very young, but perhaps it is thanks to your help that it can become extensive.  

Each component (module) was created with a single desire - to make development as interesting as possible and finally get rid of many routine things and, of course, get rid of a lot of errors / leaks / problems

At the moment, the package is in heavy development and you can watch how it will grow by subscribing to the repository or sometimes going to the [API](/api) tab

## What is this Devote inspired by?

Many solutions interested me from Sleitnick and many other grandiose developers such as Evaera and so on. A lot of cool things are also implemented in the world of Web development.

A lot of ideas that need to be implemented come straight from my Wishlist, which only increase in number every day of routine development.
